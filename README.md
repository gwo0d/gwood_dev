# gwood.dev

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, [gwood.dev](https://gwood.dev).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine.

### Installing

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gwo0d/gwo0d.github.io.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd gwo0d.github.io
    ```
3.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the development server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will open a new tab in your browser with the local version of the website. The server will automatically reload the page when you make changes to the source files.

## Building for production

To build the project for production, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with the optimized and minified files ready for deployment.
