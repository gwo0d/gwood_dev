# gwood.dev

This is the source code for my personal website, [gwood.dev](https://gwood.dev).

## Tech Stack

- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gwo0d/gwood_dev.git
    ```
2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the development server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start a local server, typically at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Building for production

To build the project for production, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with the production-ready files.
